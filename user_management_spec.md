# User Management Interface Specification

## Overview
This document provides detailed specifications for the User Management Interface used within an application. It outlines the components, their behavior, and the interactions users can have with the interface. This specification aims to guide developers in implementing a robust and user-friendly user management system.

## User Interface Components

### User List Table
- **Description**: Displays a list of all users with relevant details.
- **Columns**:
  - **ID**: Unique numeric identifier for each user.
  - **User Name**: The username associated with each user account.
  - **Email**: The user's email address.
  - **Enabled**: Boolean value indicating whether the user account is active.
- **Features**:
  - **Sorting**: Each column header can be clicked to sort the table by that column.
  - **Filtering**: Includes a checkbox to hide disabled users from the list.

### New User Form
- **Description**: Allows for the addition of new users or editing existing users.
- **Fields**:
  - **Username**: Text field for entering the user's username.
  - **Display Name**: Text field for entering the user's display name.
  - **Phone**: Text field for entering the user's phone number.
  - **Email**: Text field for entering the user's email address.
  - **User Roles**: Dropdown menu for selecting the user's role (options include Guest, Admin, SuperAdmin).
  - **Enabled**: Checkbox to enable or disable the user account.
- **Actions**:
  - **Save User**: Button to save the information entered into the form. Updates the user's details if existing, or adds a new user if new entry.

## Page Behavior

### Initial Load
- **On Load**: The page retrieves and displays all users from the database.
- **Default View**: The table displays all users, including those who are disabled, unless filtered out.

### User Interactions
- **Adding Users**: Clicking the "+New User" button clears the form, allowing for entry of a new user's details.
- **Editing Users**: Clicking on an existing user in the list populates the form with that user's details for editing.
- **Saving Users**: The "Save User" button submits the form data. The system checks if it's a new user or an existing user update based on the form state.

## Technical Requirements

### Accessibility
- Ensure that all form elements and interactive components are accessible using keyboard navigation and are readable by screen readers.

### Security
- Implement secure handling of user data, especially when transmitting personal information over the network. Ensure all data transfers are done over HTTPS.

### Responsive Design
- The interface should be responsive, adjusting appropriately for different device screens from mobiles to desktops.
